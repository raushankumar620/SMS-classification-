In the SMS classification project  implemented, various Python libraries and techniques are utilized. Here's a comprehensive list:

1. Data Handling and Manipulation:
pandas: Used for reading the CSV file, data manipulation, and preprocessing.

Functions used: read_csv, drop, rename, apply, value_counts, describe, isnull, duplicated, drop_duplicates.
numpy: Often used for numerical operations but primarily included in the imports.

2. Data Visualization:
matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs and visualizations.

Functions used: pyplot, figure, show.
seaborn: Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Functions used: histplot, pairplot, heatmap, catplot, barplot.
wordcloud: Used to generate word cloud visualizations of the text data.

Classes used: WordCloud.
3. Text Preprocessing:
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for text processing and manipulation.

Functions used: word_tokenize, sent_tokenize, download.
Corpus used: stopwords.
Stemmer used: PorterStemmer.
string: Used for string manipulation, particularly for removing punctuation.

4. Machine Learning Models:
scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Preprocessing: LabelEncoder (for encoding target labels).
Model selection: train_test_split (for splitting data into training and testing sets).
Metrics: accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, precision_score.
Models:
GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB (Naive Bayes classifiers).
LogisticRegression (Logistic Regression).
SVC (Support Vector Classifier).
DecisionTreeClassifier (Decision Tree).
KNeighborsClassifier (K-Nearest Neighbors).
RandomForestClassifier (Random Forest).
AdaBoostClassifier (AdaBoost).
BaggingClassifier (Bagging).
ExtraTreesClassifier (Extra Trees).
GradientBoostingClassifier (Gradient Boosting).
VotingClassifier (Voting).
StackingClassifier (Stacking).
Feature extraction: CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer.
5. Model Saving and Loading:
pickle: Used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures.
Functions used: dump (for saving models), load (for loading models).
6. Miscellaneous:
collections: Specifically the Counter class, used for counting word frequencies.
warnings: For managing warnings in code execution (common in development but not explicitly used in your current code).
Project Steps Summary:
Reading and Understanding the Data: Loading data from a CSV file using pandas.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Renaming columns, handling missing values, and label encoding.
Visualizing the Data: Using matplotlib and seaborn for exploratory data analysis.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, removing stop words, and punctuation using nltk.
Model Building: Training various machine learning models with scikit-learn and evaluating their performance.
Prediction and Evaluation: Calculating accuracy and precision metrics for model evaluation.
Model Saving: Saving the trained model and vectorizer using pickle.
